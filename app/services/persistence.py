"""
Service layer for data persistence.

Handles saving and loading application state (like chat history and
conversation memory) to and from JSON files. This abstracts the file I/O
operations from the rest of the application.

# ... (Imports for json, os, Path) ...

# --- Placeholder for the full code ---
# You would move the following functions from your original app.py
# into this file:
# - save_json
# - load_json
# - load_chat_history
# - save_chat_history
# - load_conversation
# - save_conversation
#
# You would also move the `chat_history` global list here and manage it
# within this module, exposing functions to access or modify it safely.
