"""
Service layer for core chat logic.

This module handles the business logic for creating, managing, and interacting
with chats and their associated documents. It acts as an intermediary between
the API routes and the lower-level persistence and vector store services.
"""
# ... (Imports for persistence, vector_store, uuid, etc.) ...
# This file would contain logic extracted from the route functions.

# --- Placeholder for the full code ---
# You would move the following from your original file:
# - The `DocumentStore` class and its instance `document_store`
# - The logic from all chat-related routes (`get_chats`, `create_chat`, etc.)
#
# Here are a few examples of how the functions would look:

def get_all_chats() -> list:
    """Retrieves all chats, sorted by update time."""
    # Logic from the original get_chats()
    pass

def create_new_chat() -> dict:
    """Creates a new chat session."""
    # Logic from the original create_chat()
    pass

def send_message(chat_id: str, user_message: str) -> dict:
    """
    Handles an incoming message, retrieves context, gets an AI response,
    and saves the conversation.
    """
    # This is the most complex function. It would contain the logic from
    # the original send_message() function, including:
    # 1. Querying the vector store for context.
    # 2. Building the prompt for the Gemini model.
    # 3. Calling the Gemini API.
    # 4. Saving the user and model messages.
    # 5. Updating chat metadata.
    pass

# ... other functions like delete_chat, rename_chat, etc. ...
