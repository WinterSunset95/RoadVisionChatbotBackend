Service layer for handling all document processing tasks.

asynchronous upload jobs. It abstracts the complexities of file handling
and processing away from the API routes.

# ... (PDFProcessor, ExcelProcessor, and related imports) ...
# This file would contain the full classes for PDFProcessor and ExcelProcessor
# and the functions handle_pdf_upload, get_upload_job_status.

# Due to the large size of these classes, a summary is provided here.
# In a real project, you would move the full class definitions from your
# original app.py into this file.

# --- Placeholder for the full code ---
# You would move the following from your original file:
# - All imports related to document processing (LlamaParse, fitz, etc.)
# - The PDFProcessor class (all its methods)
# - The ExcelProcessor class
# - The `upload_jobs` global dictionary (it will be managed here)
#
# Then, you would create these new functions:

upload_jobs = {}
